Problem Statement:
There is no ruler in the universe of Southeros and pandemonium reigns. Shan, the gorilla king of the Space kingdom
wants to rule all Six Kingdoms in the universe of Southeros. He needs the support of 3 more kingdoms to be the ruler.
Each kingdom has an animal emblem and Shan needs to send a message with the animal in the message to win them over. LAND emblem - Panda, WATER emblem - Octopus, ICE emblem - Mammoth, AIR emblem - Owl, FIRE emblem - Dragon.
Your coding challenge is to have King Shan send secret message to each kingdom and win them over.
Once he wins 3 more kingdoms, he is the ruler! The secret message needs to contain the letters of the animal in their emblem. For example, secret message to the Land kingdom (emblem: Panda) needs to have the letter 'p','n','d' at- least once and 'a' at-least twice. If he sends "a1d22n333a4444p" to the Land kingdom, he will win them over.
